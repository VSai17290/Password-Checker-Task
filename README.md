# Password Checker
> Overview:
  As part of my internship at Prodigy Infotech, I have been tasked with developing a Password Checker tool. This tool aims to enhance security by evaluating the strength of user passwords and providing feedback to help users create stronger, more secure passwords.

> Features:
   • Password Strength Evaluation: Analyzes passwords and rates their strength based on various criteria.
   • Common Password Detection: Identifies and warns against commonly used passwords that are easy to guess.
   • Character Variety Requirement: Ensures passwords contain a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
   • Length Check: Enforces a minimum and maximum password length for enhanced security.
   • Real-time Feedback: Provides immediate feedback to users as they type their password.
   • Suggestions for Improvement: Offers suggestions to improve password strength.

> Installation:
 To set up the Password Checker, follow these steps:

  1) Clone the repository:
      Bash
      git clone https://github.com/username/password-checker.git
  3) Navigate to the project directory:
      Bash
      cd password-checker
  5) Install the necessary dependencies:
      Bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
> Usage:
  To use the Password Checker, run the following command:

  bash
  python password_checker.py
  The tool will prompt you to enter a password and will provide feedback on its strength and suggestions for improvement.
